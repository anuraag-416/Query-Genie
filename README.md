# Query Genie: Natural Language Database Querying

## Overview
Query Genie is an innovative platform that democratizes database access by allowing non-technical users to query databases using natural language.

## Key Features
- ðŸš€ Natural Language to SQL Translation
- ðŸ”’ Secure Database Access
- ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Query Generation
- ðŸ“Š Intuitive User Interface

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The high-level architecture demonstrates the core flow:
1. User inputs natural language query
2. Query is translated to SQL
3. Database is queried
4. Results are returned and formatted

### Low-Level Component Architecture

Key components include:
- Frontend: React/Next.js UI
- Backend: Express.js Server
- AI Integration: OpenAI LLM Service
- Database Connector
- Query Validation Service

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI LLMs
- **Authentication**: Custom secure access control

## Installation
